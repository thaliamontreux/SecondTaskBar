# SecondTaskBar

Launch SecondTaskBar.exe and it will create folders under appdata\roaming\secondtaskbar in the user profile and follow domain logins around. (works with windows servers and the user roaming profile) 

To Add Remove or Delete Right-Click on the bar then select add, remove or delete or settings. 

Looking for programmers who would love to expand upon this idea. Contributions are more than welcome!!
